# OOP-2015-2016-Assignment-1

The assignment assigned is to create a visualisation of a dataset using Processing.

The basic requirments of the assignment are:
  - Find a dataset with some data I want to investigate
  - Load the data into a processing scetch
  - Include at least one visualisation that we made in class
  - Include at leat one visualisation I came up with myself
  - Include a menu that allows the user to choose which visualisation to show

The features above are worth 50% of the marks for the assignment.

To get the other 50% I should add advanced features to the program. Such as, but not limited to,
  - Use Control P5 to implement a GUI with controls that allow the user to interact with the visualisations
  - Use classes
  - Display some beautiful animations
  - Do some 3D visualisation
  - Build a custom sensor using an Arduino and visualise its output
  - Visualise some geotagged data on a map
  - Use a Kinect or Leap Motion to interact with the visualisation using gestures
  - Generate the data using Fractals or some other mathematical model

##Deliverables
  - Deliverable 1: Due November 9th. A git repository for my assignment should be created. A Processing sketch should be         created that loads my chosen dataset into some data structure. The readme should include what my project is and waht I       plan to do.
  - Deliverable 2: Due December 7th. This is the final assignment submission, I should have screen-shots of my project and a     writeup of my project in the readme file. Assignment will then be demoed in the following weeks.




## Deliverable 1 (Incomplete, things may be removed if they prove too problamatic to implement)
  The data set that I have chosen is the perodic table of elements. I chose this because I thought it would be interesting if   all the pieces of data weren't the same type. The main graph I plan to use is bar graphs. I didn't pick it bacause it's the
  easiest to code but that I feel it will show the the large abount of data in the easiest way to read possible. Because of    the large amount of elements in the data set I hope to make it so that you can scroll across the elements, zoom in/out,      select/deselect which elements will be shown, select bars in the graph to get a more in depth view of that specific          element, and possibly more things.
